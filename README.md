# Time Series Forecasting

This project is part of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, where we can put your knowledge to the test in a fun and competitive environment. 

About the Competition
In this homework assignment, your goal is to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The challenge lies in designing and implementing forecasting models that effectively utilize past observations in the input sequence to accurately predict the future.
The difficult part is to develop predictive models without any prior understanding of the semantics or interpretations of the individual features present in our data. 
This presents a unique challenge, as you must rely solely on the statistical properties and patterns within the dataset to make accurate predictions.
